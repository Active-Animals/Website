# Active Animals Ontology (AAO)

Welcome to the Active Animals Ontology.

## Introduction

[Ethology](https://doi.org/10.3389/fetho.2023.1270913) is the study of proximate causes of behaviour (mechanisms and development), and their ultimate roots (evolution and function). Behaviour classification is generally [a typological ordering system](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0469.2002.00211.x)[^1]. In this ontology, we attempt to tease out some order from the, "almost chaotic diversity,"  of behaviour, by grouping its mechanisms: the more observable component of ethology.

Having undergone a closed, primordial development phase, the initiative is now open for Alpha testing and redesign. Those interested in animal behaviour, who are willing to contribute directly, are being invited to collaborate.

Sister initiatives are also being developed to test the use of labelling developed here, for annotating searchable repositories of animal behaviour records, most notably at iNaturalist. Collaborators are also being sought, who are able to test and extend these sister initiatives to their own records in various repositories.
