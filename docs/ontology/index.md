# Active Animals Ontology (AAO)

Welcome to the Active Animals Ontology.

## Introduction

[Ethology](https://doi.org/10.3389/fetho.2023.1270913) is the study of proximate causes of behaviour (mechanisms and development), and their ultimate roots (evolution and function). Behaviour classification is generally [a typological ordering system](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0469.2002.00211.x)[^1]. In this project, we are attempting to tease out some order from the, "almost chaotic diversity,"  of behaviour, by grouping its mechanisms: the more observable component of ethology.

Having undergone a closed, primordial development phase, the project is now open for Alpha testing and redesign. Those interested in animal behaviour, who are willing to contribute directly, are invited to collaborate.

Sister projects are also being developed to test the use of labelling developed here, for annotating searchable repositories of animal behaviour records, most notably at [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org). Collaborators are also being sought, who are able to test and extend these sister projects to their own records in various repositories, such as [xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org).

### Who is this for?

This ontology is designed by and for amateur animal behaviour watchers. It provides us with a system for classifying what could potentially be seen, heard, felt, or otherwise tangibly discerned by us. It can also help us to share knowledge with each other. For some of us, it could extend the scope of natural observation beyond taxonomy. For others, it may replace taxonomy as our root observational paradigm, with taxonomy having the supplementary role. In other words, 'collecting' behaviours.

A secondary use case is that of professional researchers into animal behaviour. Even if this ontology is not always consistent with the most current academic thinking, it can be used to build bridges between different interpretations or labels, as well as between 'citizens' and 'scientists'. If behaviour watchers use the labels to annotate publicly accessible instances of behaviour, it may assist professionals in searching for examples of unusual behaviour, or extensions of known behaviour to new animal taxa.

### What's an ontology?

> An ontology contains a formal classification of terminology in a domain that provides textual and machine readable definitions, and defines the relationships between terms. An ontology is a terminology, but a terminology is not (necessarily) an ontology.

> A reference ontology is meant to serve a general purpose, providing terms for some domain of science. We can compare it to a textbook. An application ontology is meant to serve a specific purpose, limited to a particular project or institution, but often crossing several domains. An application ontology is likely to include terms from several reference ontologies. Reference ontologies focus almost exclusively on universals, while application ontologies are more likely to include terms for particulars.

#### What is the AAO?

This is an editable reference ontology for animal behaviours. It defines, labels, and interconnects potentially discernible actions and functional contexts. Using scientific references, it attempts to provide an internally consistent framework for classifying assertions which have been made about these behaviours.

In addition, it offers a range of non-behavioural classes (e.g. qualities), mainly imported from other ontologies, which can help situate certain behaviours.

#### What isn't the AAO?

This is not a reference for potentially maladaptive behaviours, and excludes so-called abnormal, aberrant, deficient, pathological, diseased, or impaired behaviour. We acknowledge that some acute stress-related behaviours are adaptive and so include them, but that chronic stress leads to maladaptive or compensatory behaviours, which we therefore do not include.

However, damage, variability, phenotype, and physiological state are referenced in the non-behaviour part of this ontology, alongside personality. These are all possible modulators of what could otherwise be adaptive behaviours.

NB: We are not describing specific individuals, except as instances for illustration and typing.

### How does it work?

You use the ontology's labels to annotate an instance of behaviour (e.g. one of your photos, sound recordings, or video clips). To find the right label, you need to look in the behavior branch hierarchy. You might be able to work your own way through a particular sub-branch to what you are looking for. Or you might want to try searching for a word you think is in the ontology somewhere. Bear in mind that some behaviours are listed with more than one parent class, or as part of another, so you might come at what you are looking for from different routes.

It might also be, that you want to add one or more non-behaviour classes to your annotation. The taxonomic characteristics (e.g. species) will be managed by your observation's host platform, if you are using a depository like iNaturalist to save your observations.

Only in exceptional cases do we label composite behaviours (usually if they have a unique term, or if they are synergistic and not merely additive). In other words, if you wish to label a co-occurent set of behaviours, label each one of them. The same goes for non-behaviours.

Remember that much is missing from the ontology and you may need to offer edits to existing entries, or new terms.

If you want to improve the ontology, make sure you understand the section, [Can I contribute?](#can-i-contribute) Then tuck into the page about [Editing](ontology/editing).

NB: You may offer edits to this Introduction or the Editing page too, although anything but typos in the Editing page may need some debate before being adopted by us all.
