# Active Animals Ontology (AAO)

Welcome to the Active Animals Ontology.

## Introduction

[Ethology](https://doi.org/10.3389/fetho.2023.1270913) is the study of proximate causes of behaviour (mechanisms and development), and their ultimate roots (evolution and function). Behaviour classification is generally [a typological ordering system](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0469.2002.00211.x)[^1]. In this ontology, we attempt to tease out some order from the, "almost chaotic diversity,"  of behaviour, by grouping its mechanisms: the more observable component of ethology.

Having undergone a closed, primordial development phase, the initiative is now open for Alpha testing and redesign. Those interested in animal behaviour, who are willing to contribute directly, are being invited to collaborate.

Sister initiatives are also being developed to test the use of labelling developed here, for annotating searchable repositories of animal behaviour records, most notably at iNaturalist. Collaborators are also being sought, who are able to test and extend these sister initiatives to their own records in various repositories.

## What's an ontology?

> An ontology contains a formal classification of terminology in a domain that provides textual and machine readable definitions, and defines the relationships between terms. An ontology is a terminology, but a terminology is not (necessarily) an ontology.

> A reference ontology is meant to serve a general purpose, providing terms for some domain of science. We can compare it to a textbook. An application ontology is meant to serve a specific purpose, limited to a particular project or institution, but often crossing several domains. An application ontology is likely to include terms from several reference ontologies. Reference ontologies focus almost exclusively on universals, while application ontologies are more likely to include terms for particulars.

### What is the AAO?

This is an editable reference ontology for animal behaviours. It defines, labels, and interconnects potentially discernible actions and functional contexts. Using scientific references, it attempts to provide an internally consistent framework for classifying assertions which have been made about these behaviours.

In addition, it offers a range of non-behavioural classes (e.g. qualities), mainly imported from other ontologies, which can help situate certain behaviours.

### What isn't the AAO?

This is not a reference for potentially maladaptive behaviours, and excludes so-called abnormal, aberrant, deficient, pathological, diseased, or impaired behaviour. We acknowledge that some acute stress-related behaviours are adaptive and so include them, but that chronic stress leads to maladaptive or compensatory behaviours, which we therefore do not include.

However, damage, variability, phenotype, and physiological state are referenced in the non-behaviour part of this ontology, alongside personality. These are all possible modulators of what could otherwise be adaptive behaviours.

NB: We are not describing specific individuals, except as instances for illustration and typing.
