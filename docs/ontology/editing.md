# Active Animals Ontology (AAO)

Welcome! We're all about classifying animal behaviour and cataloguing observations.

## EDITING

On our [INTRODUCTION](index) page, you can find out more about our use case, model, and how to participate. ***If you would like to collaborate, check out its section: [Can I contribute?](index#can-i-contribute)***

Here we will outline our guidelines and rules for contributing to the ontology.

### Always...

#### Bites

The history tab in WebProtégé will be easiest for future users to follow, if every edit is small, containing only a bitesize of material. Working in WebProtégé this will happen automatically. But if the manager approves of editing using an external editor such as Protégé, you will need to save and upload after every significant edit (i.e. not each word, but perhaps after each annotation has been added or edited).

Only if a thematic edit is undertaken offline, multiple edits may be handled in a single save. In due course, we hope to have a GitHub pipeline set up to allow merging of branches (e.g. offline edits in Protégé) with the main file. Commits then will still need to be made very frequently. Over the horizon, we also hope that WebProtégé will be upgraded to allow merges with offline files without using a GitHub pipeline, or directly tied into it instead of being fully stand-alone as at present.

#### Commits

Every edit merged into WebProtégé is called a Commit. It may not be obvious what an edit is doing. Therefore WebProtégé automatically adds a title to each change you make which it merges in, focused on the activity undertaken.

If approved, Protégé uploads overwriting the WebProtégé file will have an unhelpful generic title. This needs to be changed to give a useful idea of what the edit has done. Make a quick reference to any prior discussion on the site about the topic. If there is no prior discussion about the change within the history, it may be better to have the discussion first, but if it can't be helped, then add some reasoning for the change to the Commit.

NB: The primordial version of the ontology has been developed as a unitary draft, without edited Commits, but from the time joint editing started, the original author became subject to this expectation.
