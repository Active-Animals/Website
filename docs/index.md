Welcome to the Active Animals website.

We are currently in the Alpha phase, so many aspects of the Active Animals initiative are under construction and have limited functionality or access.

We operate with a **[ CC0 1.0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)  No Copyright** licence.

## Ontology

If you're interested in the business of classifying animal behaviour, this is the place for you.

On the following pages, you can find an [INTRODUCTION](ontology/index) to the ontology (a kind of uber-glossary).

Its [SCOPING](ontology/scoping) page reflects on the need for it and a potted history.

If you're keen on collaborating to develop the **technology** processes for it, to curate its **content**, or to support its **public** facies such as this website, take a look at the [EDITING](ontology/editing) page.

## Labels

The ontology hosts a plethora of labels, synonyms, definitions, and other provenance or explanatory information. Most users will not come here to look at the detailed ontology though. They will want to search out labels to apply to behaviours they have observed and recorded, perhaps as photos, videos, or recordings.

This function is not yet finalised for general users. if however, you wish to stress-test the ontology's labels against your observations, feel free to contact the manager to see if there is room for you to have access to the ontology directly. Check out the INTRODUCTION section: [Can I contribute?](/ontologyindex#can-i-contribute)
